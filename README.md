# Local Gym
A gym franchise called “Club Ex” would like to expand their customer base. They are looking to make all their online content available so that people can work-out from home or from work rather than having to come into the gym. Current gym members will automatically have access to the content, whereas new users can subscribe just to the online content (without having to join up with a full gym membership). The “Club Ex” CEO wants a demo app, which will eventually be expanded to be the full-blown app. The SCRUM team will need to develop a “Club Ex” app that: 

1) Allows current members to create a login, and non-gym members to join on a subscription plan and login 

   a) Two subscription plans available – 1-year subscription for $100, 1-month subscription for $10 

2) Provides a list of the available online content, grouped according to the gym’s specifications 

   a) Vertical groupings = Pilates, Yoga, Boxing, Aerobics 

   b) Each grouping can be scrolled horizontally, to find full list 

3) Allow content to be searched using a generic search bar (with drop down suggestions, like Google) 

4) Keeps a running total of how many times a video has been viewed, for feedback to the gym 

5) Videos can be rated by the customer, e.g. like / dislike, or ranking from 1 -5 stars (students to decide) 

6) A stats page that shows the name of the video that was viewed, and how long it was viewed for i.e. a lifetime tally of the workout time (students to think about how best to show this)
